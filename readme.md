## Page to Take Attendence

This app fed by a excel file named 'names.xlsx'. Names in this excel files shown on the page and user could click one of this 3 options:
- DONE (green)
- Absent (red)
- "-" (orange)

All boxes marked as "-" (orange) as default.

I use this to check players in a game in an organization. We checked all the people if they join the game or not. If they didnt come to organization area I marked them as absent.

Actually this page has no database connection or smth, as I mentioned before, this made for a game :D
